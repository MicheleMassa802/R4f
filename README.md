# Aqua
Aqua is an application/website that lets its users take on the roles of a seller or customer while navigating the user-created Aqua Mall stores with high level of customization that make the shopping experience easier and less reliant on end-to-end communication between customers and sellers.

When it comes to the selling of services, sellers can create detailed ITEM structure slips made to fit all the details required for an order/service to be completed, which are to be filled and submitted by customers along with each order.

Customers can look for specific services/item-specific-stores through the cashtag system ($) using the search system, and stores can be followed in order to build a more personalized experience.
