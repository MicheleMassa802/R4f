# R4f
R4f is a website that works as a birthday tracker for people who are close to you, making use of a Java backend, MySQL database, HTML and CSS UI, and a TomCat server. 

What divides R4f from other birthday trackers is the way you get the birthdays of those important people onto your calendar. As a user, you get your own calendar assigned to you, which comes with a link to a survey, this link can be shared onto your social media, and as people start filling this survey with their basic birthday information (day, month, year, name, last name, social media link/s), R4f automatically allocates some space in your calendar to fit that persons birthday in order to remind you of it.

In order to get the notification across, R4f sends you an email on the days of your calendar where a birthday has been allocated, along with the information of the person related to the birthday and a set of randomized possible default messages which can be sent to congratulate these people.

The app is not about caring less about the special occasions by making sure you dont worry too much about them, it is about making sure you can remember to make the special occasions special with the fast paced life we are all stuck in.

# Where to download, where to use...

I'll leave the usage instructions down here even if the project is still not published, this line will be removed once Im done with setting up the publishing details...

# Downloading R4F

If you are anything like me and appreciate some good old fashioned command line action [so if you are preferably used to coding and compiling projects], then you can go ahead and clone the repo, in there follow the directories in the following way: R4F_project -> Project4 -> project4.

This project4 folder is the one that contains the src folder where the actual application code resides, so you can use your IDE of preference to open the folder, navigate into: src -> main -> java -> com -> server4 -> MainPage, and once in the MainPage package, open up the Main.java file, run this file in order to experience R4F through command line prompts, in a very raw fashion.

# Using the R4F website

If you are more normal however and prefer to look at pretty UIs (at least pretty in my opinion hehe), then you would want to visit the website. You don't need to download anything in order to use the website, and to be honest its the best way to interactively experience R4F.

The link to the website is the following: ########################################


# Important Notes:

Note, all of the files in this project have been fully developed by me, Michele Massa, if you are interested in talking to me about coding, why I did something the way I did, or want to use a file, please ask for permission by shooting an email at: michelemassa802@gmail.com. It takes no effort and is a little nicer than just stealing my code. 

All of the files under this project are copyrighted under copyright (c) 2022 Michele Massa. So please, ask for permission if you want to use my files.

Aside from copying files, I am also not going to be open to collaboration in the project since its more of solo development thing that I really wanted to experience, if you have any recommendations as far as making it better however, or want to hire me to code something for you, once again shoot me an email at: michelemassa802@gmail.com.

# THANK YOU

Just making it all the way down here is special enough to me, even if you end up not using R4F, I wanted to thank you for visiting my project page, it really makes the 200+ hours spent between learning new coding languages, learning about database usage, learning about website making and server usage, and obviously, coding the actual thing, really worth it.

This has been Michele, I hope you have a great day!
