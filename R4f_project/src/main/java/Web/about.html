					<h1>About me, and R4F</h1>
					<p>Hey there, I am Arael_00, the sole creator of R4F, and I wanted to thank you for visiting my website.</p>
					<p>I started this project back in November of 2021, with the main goal of solving a personal problem (which you may have guessed is keeping track of the birthdays of important people close to me), and a professional one (project experience looks good on resumes kids!). From sketches, graphs, brainstorming and problem solving done over my christmas break of 2021, to starting the code with Java, MySQL, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, pushing all of the different pieces and joining them together over my summer break of 2022, it has been tougher than I thought, but I'm glad you can enjoy the result.</p>
					<p>If you ever wondered what the name R4F means, then this line is the right place to look for an answer! When thinkin of the name for such a project I was looking at color names since they tend to sound pretty cool, and end up being a nice way to also set the theme color for the website/UI. My two main contenders ended up being the colors with the hex codes #00ffff and #ff400f, which are Aqua and Vivid Red. Aqua seemed like a pretty good name, but I liked Vivid Red a little more as a color, however its name was not cool at all, so looking at their hex codes, I did some pretty weird mental gymnastics and ended up with two other names, for Aqua, the name would be 0GB as in 0 in red, FF in green and FF in blue; and on the other side, Vivid Red had the much cooler sounding R4F as in FF in red, 40 in green, and 0f in blue. Therefore, since I liked the color a little more, and the name was way cooler and edgier sounding, R4F became a thing, which I gave the official pronunciation of "raf", with the code name being "Project 4", even though this is not my fourth project lmao. </p>
                    <p>Now for some information about me, which is a nice way to semi-doxx myself on the internet... I am a student working towards his CS specialist at the University of Toronto who is really into side projects, video games, and web development in general (even though my CSS skills may say otherwise at times). I took upon this challenge to get a good grip on all the things I may have to handle when developing other projects (both for school and personal), so I can be prepared for anything that's thrown at me (clean architecture management, back-end code, front-end code, linking to a database, ...).</p>
					<p>I hope this adventure of mine that has been the creation of this project has been of good use to you, user, and if you have any suggestions, concerns, or you just want to get into contact with me, then please either shoot me an email at: massamichele802@gmail.com, or add me on discord at: michelemassa_802#2066.</p>
					<p>If you want to take a look at my code, I have made the github repo public at the time of release, so feel free to look through it for inspiration, or whatever it is us coders like to stare at other's code for... The link is the following:</p>

					<p>Also, the picture of Donkey from Shrek is just there for the professional touch that would normally be having a picture of myself, however, I do not want to further doxx myself, and furthermore, at all levels but physical, I consider myself to be very well represented by Donkey.</p>
