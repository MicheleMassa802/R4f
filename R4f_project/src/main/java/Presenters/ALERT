Review when its time to make presenters and once the topic has been reviewed.
The controllers will allow for the usage of the entities to execute any use case from the main loop, while the presenters are there to dictate how to display these entities to the user, the inputs they need to fill, text fields, etc...
Users are prompted for the required information for an action executed by a controller before the action of the controller is called, the tree in the main loop handles this decision making and information storage
So the job of these presenter pages is to hold the constants needed to display the entities they refer to when these entities are to be displayed.
The presenters should be worked on along with the working on the website to know which stuff to store in the presenters.
